We all hear excuses all the time from our own orgs and others for why they can't implement a specific idea, such as salary transparency. Let's write all the excuses we've heard, and then come up with scripts for how to counter them.",

We will share tips and tricks with each other, and focus on solutions. The facilitator will give an overview of how to request disability accommodations in the workplace per the Americans With Disabilities Act, and will share personal experiences with the process.\n\nThose who do not identify as neurodivergent or as having ADHD are welcome to attend as listeners in order to learn how to best provide support — we politely ask that you do not share solutions or experiences if you choose to attend.",

Some things to consider: Do you pay candidates for the time they spend on hiring tests? Do you know what you're testing for? Do you really need them to edit a 2,000-word story, write a cover letter that guesses at what you want to hear, or spend hours crafting a story that you get to publish for free?\n\nNewsrooms have not traditionally considered the application process from the candidate's point of view. Yet this is the person's first interaction with your organization. If you say you're a newsroom that values a person's time, how do you show it in the application process? This session will offer some ideas that will hopefully jumpstart more from the room.",

    "description": "In the age of online communication, we have more information and stellar writing at our fingertips than ever before. And yet during the pandemic people were taking horse medicine and refusing vaccines. How can we ensure that the painstaking work journalists put into informing people about the knowledge science offers reaches people in an age of rampant misinformation, disinformation, and polarization? Covering science brings up particular social cues around elitism, risk perception, how knowledge is formed, and which institutions are trustworthy in which situations. We’ll reflect on several major themes that have regularly come up in science coverage in recent years: the pandemic (vaccines, masks, school openings, testing, and lockdown); issues of inequality in science professions and education; and climate change. \n\nSeveral scholars who study science misinformation will be available to help our group develop best practices for reporting on polarized (or potentially polarizing) science topics. Stephan Lewandowsky (University of Bristol), Jiyoung Lee (University of Alabama), Jaime Longoria (Disinfo Defense League, Media Democracy Fund), and Scott Knowles (COVIDCalls, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) will summarize insights from their research and will field questions.\n\nThe session will begin with 15 minutes of getting to know the panelists. Then we’ll spend 15 minutes sharing with one another what experiences we’ve had with these issues and questions. Finally, we’ll end with 30 minutes of Q&A with the panelists, focusing the discussion around the following scenarios:\n\n- You are covering a science topic during a disaster (such as a pandemic) that is becoming polarized. How do you consider your coverage angle and larger dissemination strategy? How do you respond to pushback from audience members? How do you protect yourself and your sources from burnout, online attack, and other negative outcomes?\n- You are covering an issue related to inequality in science (such as critical race theory studies of STEM practices and professions, a sexual harassment case, issues surrounding medical gender transition, or the exclusion of early-career, immigrant women from the Nobel Prize). You know the issue is important to cover and newsworthy, but you also know that there will be backlash from your audience—which could exacerbate these issues. How do you approach your coverage and then how do you preempt or respond to the backlash?\n- You are covering an issue related to an entrenched polarized topic, climate change, that has long been muddied by disinformation and that looms large in culture wars and politics. This topic, one of society’s most important, turns off almost everyone: People who are concerned feel overwhelmed and don’t want to read about it; people who are dismissive will likely ignore your reporting or, worse, be angered by it. What do you do to approach covering the topic constructively?\n- What practices and policies would prevent this kind of polarization and backlash in the first place?\n- What emerging communication technologies could help or exacerbate these issues? How can journalists prepare?\n\nAs these discussions progress, we’ll develop Google Doc with a set of take-home points and best practices for covering polarizing topics.",

Sometimes our harshest critics are wrong, sure, but sometimes they see where we're missing perspectives, or failing them with reporting that doesn't push hard enough.\n\nSo how do we make sure we know the difference? Can we productively tell our critics when they're wrong? More importantly, can we admit to ourselves when they're right? How can we spot real opportunities to grow, to learn from the people engaging with our work, to reach into our communities and build trust?

Both fanfiction and journalism exist on the same spectrum of objectivity, even if they’re on different ends: People make choices about what stories they’re telling, whose narratives they’re centering and what words they use to describe them. One of the ways journalism and fanfiction diverge that this session will cover: Fanfiction in itself is a sort of science fiction; we’re writing about an existence that is possible within the confines of an already existing world. By engaging with fanfiction and related communities, we have a chance to learn more about what it means to explore our identities, develop narratives which center the agency of marginalized communities and connect with folks from different backgrounds via common ground about a world that might be better than our own.",

    "description": "We're innovators. Product thinkers. Transformers of culture. We're everything our newsrooms need...if only anyone would let us implement our ideas.\n\nToo often, the people ready to introduce real, radical, positive change at their organizations aren't the ones given the authority to do so. Even the people tasked with being change agents aren't always given the institutional backing needed to make change happen.\n\nIn this problem may lie an opportunity, because leading by influence can turn out to be a more effective tool, in the long run, than a top-down approach. Is soft power just what traditional power needs to become?\n\nIn this session, we'll share stories and strategies for becoming leaders regardless of title and in the face of individual and structural challengers of that power. How can we amass soft power at our organizations, while building communities of support and resilience? What are the skills we can build that allow us to be as effective, if not more, than a formal manager? And what are the changes that are worth putting ourselves on the line for?",

    "description": "In 2022, KPCC/LAist set out to redesign its coverage of the climate emergency through human-centered design research. We started with a few key questions: How do Southern Californians experience climate change, how can we lower barriers to understanding, and what type of information is most relevant and useful in their daily lives? We emerged from 20 interviews with a new set of guiding principles for the beat and four types of climate change information seekers to focus on serving. \n\nIn this session we will introduce you to our coverage principles and our four archetypes. Then we’ll move into breakout groups; each group will be given a different archetype to design a prototype for. We’ll reconvene to share everyone’s ideas. (We were inspired by the SRCCON 2021 session led by Lindsay Abrams, where she did something similar based on research from CNN.)",

    "facilitators": "Andrew Ba Tran, Lam Thuy Vo",
    "description": "We no longer consume news through a handful of TV channels and newspapers—even the best journalism now moves through a media ecosystem full of cable commentary, social media, politically motivated actors, and motivated readers. And that makes it possible for our most well-meaning work, the accurate and illuminating coverage that people really need, to get remixed or misused in service of horrifying, harmful narratives.\n\nSo what should we do when readers draw selfish or wrong conclusions from our stories or data analysis? Like when researchers said that white Americans became less empathetic and less fearful of COVID-19 after reading about how COVID-19 disproportionately impacts poorer people and communities of color. Or when data about clinical, gender-expansive care for children was scraped by conspiracy theorists and used to target those providers.\n\nThe old tenets of journalism tell us we should just present the data and let people draw their own conclusions. But what responsibility do we have when some of those conclusions are terrible?",

    "description": "The pandemic has blurred the division between our work and family lives, and shifted what we value. It has fundamentally reshaped our relationship with work. Newsroom managers can no longer assume journalism as usual. More and more, journalists are challenging traditional newsroom culture and systems from presenteeism to management style to performance evaluation to work-life balance. Let's design an adoptable newsroom management framework that focus on empathy, flexibility and share-ownership in order to unlock your team's full potential.",

    "description": "COVID-19 threw journalists everywhere into a daily data-tracking exercise with no notice and no guardrails. The pandemic brought skills and techniques normally reserved for well-understood topics like elections to the forefront of our coverage plans—without nearly enough time to make sure we understood the data ourselves, let alone communicate what it meant to readers.\n\nWe've overhauled our workflows; we've struggled with missing and incomplete data; we've stretched our teams and our development environments to their limits. A few years into this experiment (and collective experience), we need to take a step back and reflect:\n\n* Are we making data-driven dashboards for our readers or ourselves?\n* How do we keep sight of the fact that each number in these datasets represents a human life?\n* Projects like these draw a lot of traffic and praise—but are we staying focused on what's most valuable to the public?\n* And what did we learn (if anything!) that can contribute to other collaborative workflows?\n\nOur hope is to come out of this conversation with better ideas for tackling the technical and editorial logistics behind *very* open-ended data projects.",

### Welcome to SRCCON!

**[Check out the schedule for SRCCON 2022!](/schedule)**

* **Registration for SRCCON 2022 is now closed!** To be notified as soon as we announce our next event, [sign up for our newsletter](https://opennews.org/newsletter).
* **Registered attendees:** You can start participating right now, with a [participant walkthrough guide](/participant-prep/). Plus, [all the sign-in links you need are here on Eventbrite](/signin).

Here's our program for the week of SRCCON.

#### The Program (Wednesday-Friday, June 22-24)

* **Talks:** The three talks on our program this year create a common foundation to build on during conversations throughout the week. SRCCON participants can watch them in advance and submit questions ahead of time, or join us live to watch the talks and participate in Q&As with the speakers.
* **Sessions:** Participatory sessions create space to get into the biggest problems facing journalism, together. Community members will facilitate peer conversations and hands-on workshops that draw on the experience of every attendee in the (Zoom) room.
* **Meetups & group conversations:** SRCCON makes time for a set of sessions about life at work and outside of it â€” hobbies, games, and other activities. Some are on the schedule, some will happen in the Slack, and others will emerge organically throughout the week.

#### The SRCCON Slack (Tuesday-Tuesday, June 21-28)

Every SRCCON is a community. Our weeklong event Slack is a space to meet other attendees, share and discover projects, keep talking about sessions, and find emergent conversations. And when SRCCON is over, we'll gather up links and trade contact info, then sign out till next year.

### About {{ page.event_name }}

The SRCCON program is focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. At SRCCON, youâ€™ll:

* Be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine newsroom tech, teamwork, leadership, community, and journalism itselfâ€”not panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn.
* Connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalismâ€”not just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* Bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the scheduleâ€”even games & mealsâ€”as ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

SRCCON will be a place to re-energize, personally and professionally, where the care participants take with one another animates every piece of our shared program. The conversations that happen here come from the community and reflect its values:

* **We lead change**â€”by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for long-lasting change in our organizations, led by journalists of color and journalists in local and regional newsrooms.
* **We support one another**â€”by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We experiment in the open**â€”by sharing our work and processes, we do the transformative work our organizations need to better connect with and inform our communities.

Our work exists to create a future where journalists can work in newsrooms that are equitable, inclusive, and collaborative. We hold space for you to bring your entire self to SRCCON, just as we hope that one day everyone will be able to bring their whole selves to workâ€”instead of feeling the need to self-oppress because of identity or background. We also hope to provide the community, environment, and support you need to focus on your work (or what you're passionate about), and at least for a while, do it without carrying extra weight.

### Who attends SRCCON events

Our participants represent organizations ranging from massive to tiny, and come from all over the U.S. and many other countries. Accessibility is a core value, and we always offer live session transcripts and tons of documentation throughout the conference. Just like last year, much of the SRCCON program will be available across multiple time zones and through asynchronous participationâ€”if you need to take care of the popsicle your kid just dropped on the floor or step away for an urgent call, we want to make it possible to participate around the complexity of this moment.

SRCCON participants are developers, designers, journalists, editors, and allies: the practitioners and leaders who are transforming their newsrooms into more representative and innovative places to work. Participants come to SRCCON to change journalism by creating more intentional processes, better relationships with the communities they cover, and new ways to engage and inform people.

### How much does it cost?

[Ticket prices start at $125](/attendees/#tickets), plus ticketing fees. We'll also offer a limited number of need-based, [free scholarship tickets as well as $250 stipends](/scholarships) for attendees whose time to attend would otherwise be uncompensated.

SRCCON events don't have open sale dates or lotteries. If you want to come to {{ page.event_name }}, our [call for participation](/participation/form) is how to let us know.

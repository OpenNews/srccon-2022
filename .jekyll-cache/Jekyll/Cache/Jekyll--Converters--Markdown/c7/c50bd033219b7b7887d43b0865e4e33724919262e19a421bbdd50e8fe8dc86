I"Z<p>We’re innovators. Product thinkers. Transformers of culture. We’re everything our newsrooms need…if only anyone would let us implement our ideas.</p>

<p>Too often, the people ready to introduce real, radical, positive change at their organizations aren’t the ones given the authority to do so. Even the people tasked with being change agents aren’t always given the institutional backing needed to make change happen.</p>

<p>In this problem may lie an opportunity, because leading by influence can turn out to be a more effective tool, in the long run, than a top-down approach. Is soft power just what traditional power needs to become?</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll share stories and strategies for becoming leaders regardless of title and in the face of individual and structural challengers of that power. How can we amass soft power at our organizations, while building communities of support and resilience? What are the skills we can build that allow us to be as effective, if not more, than a formal manager? And what are the changes that are worth putting ourselves on the line for?</p>

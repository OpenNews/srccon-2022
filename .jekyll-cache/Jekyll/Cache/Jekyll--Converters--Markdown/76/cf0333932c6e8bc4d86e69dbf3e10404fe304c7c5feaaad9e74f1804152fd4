I"Ä<p>Trans and nonbinary people are increasingly in the news, as states pass laws regulating access to healthcare, sports teams, and educational materials. But when youâ€™re trying to frame stories about these issues, it can be hard to cut through misinformation, much less resolve ethical concerns. Even legacy media outlets that set the tone for industry coverage have outdated style guides.</p>

<p>Join a facilitated discussion on how to cover policies and data that impact an estimated 1.4 million adults and 150,000 youth in the United States. Weâ€™ll address best practices for: developing internal style guides, using flawed or limited data, asking about pronouns and identity, and finding sources to fact-check common misinformation.</p>

<p>If you feel like it, please come with examples of your newsroomâ€™s written policies on quoting trans sources and covering trans issues! We will discuss some sample policies that are already publicly available.</p>

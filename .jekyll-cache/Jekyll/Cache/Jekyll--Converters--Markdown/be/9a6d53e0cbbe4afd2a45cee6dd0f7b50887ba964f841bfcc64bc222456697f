I"Ò<p>At a moment when the legal status of abortion rights across the U.S. is in question, many newsrooms are unsure how to report on the issue without putting abortion providers and activists at risk of legal action, violence, and harassment. Many are doing work that might be perfectly legal one week, and made illegal the next week. Reporting on this beat could ‚Äúout‚Äù activists and providers who do not want to be identified. Some of these communities have developed stronger security practices, and demand the same of reporters who want to speak to them. We also have to ask: What is our role in minimizing risk to sources when reporting on abortion rights? Considering the many digital trails that could identify someone‚Äîwhether electronic communications or location data connecting them to an abortion provider‚Äîwhat can we do to minimize risk?</p>

<p>Freedom of the Press Foundation and journalist Jessica Bruder want to facilitate a session on risk minimization strategies, with a mind to the operational security practices seen in reporting in the wild. Through this discussion, we will build on each others‚Äô understanding and produce some concrete recommendations for reporters and those who may assist reporters in digital security practices.</p>

I"S<p>“I wish I had more time to…[fill in the blank: work on a passion project / connect with sources / REST / etc.].” If that thought has ever crossed your mind, you are certainly not alone.</p>

<p>So many of us are strapped for time. The rapid pace of news, particularly over the past few years, has led to exhaustion and burnout. Constant deadlines and other day-to-day tasks can also make it hard to focus on longer-term priorities. In this interactive presentation, you will get a chance to step back, reflect on your work, and figure out what to stop doing — and find ways to focus on your most important, high-impact tasks. You will come away with a framework for how to assess your tasks and think strategically about how you spend your time.</p>

<p>We hope that by participating in these sessions, you will have the opportunity to talk candidly and thoughtfully about what is truly most important to focus on and what you can cut away. We will also discuss strategies you can employ to start this discussion with your manager and get their approval to focus your time in different ways.</p>

I"ƒ<p>Whenever DestinÃ©e-Charisse Royal conducts her popular workshop on how to have difficult conversations in newsrooms, she shares steps to discuss racism, sexism and all manner of uncomfortable topics. At the end, there never seems to be enough time for questions. So in this session, she will zero in on a few key prep points â€” like offering your lenses and 10xing your empathy.

And then the floor will open for questions and discussions about how to approach the conversations we have been putting off.</p>

I"F<p>Welcome to SRCCON 2022’s documentation day! In this hands-on workshop, we’ll collect and share best practices for effective and accessible internal documentation. Then we’ll put the tips to use while participating in a documentation jam session, where everyone gets to select and work on a personal documentation need. Music will be played, jokes will be made, but ultimately you’ll walk away with a template for hosting your very own documentation day when you get back to your newsroom. Hey, maybe you’ll even make documentation a quarterly event with your team!</p>

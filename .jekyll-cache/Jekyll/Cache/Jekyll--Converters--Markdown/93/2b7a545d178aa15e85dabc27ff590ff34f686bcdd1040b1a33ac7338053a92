<p>We need YOU to help make SRCCON work. In addition to participants leading sessions throughout our conferences, we also need a small group of people to help us keep things running smoothly. Want to help? Consider volunteering.</p>

<p>We need volunteers throughout the event to help us make it an accessible space online and are especially interested in support from folks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>across various time zones</li>
  <li>with comfort on different technical platforms</li>
  <li>with flexibility and a willingness to learn as we go</li>
</ul>

<p>Volunteering will be a significant time commitment. For offering that time and missing out on some (but not all!) of the festivities, you will have our gratitude, free entry to the event, and the knowledge that you played an integral role in making SRCCON a success.</p>

<p>If you want to attend a SRCCON event and are excited about playing this type of vital support role, <a href="mailto:srccon@opennews.org">please email us for information</a> about volunteering.</p>

I"ç<p>COVID-19 threw journalists everywhere into a daily data-tracking exercise with no notice and no guardrails. The pandemic brought skills and techniques normally reserved for well-understood topics like elections to the forefront of our coverage plansâ€”without nearly enough time to make sure we understood the data ourselves, let alone communicate what it meant to readers.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve overhauled our workflows; weâ€™ve struggled with missing and incomplete data; weâ€™ve stretched our teams and our development environments to their limits. A few years into this experiment (and collective experience), we need to take a step back and reflect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are we making data-driven dashboards for our readers or ourselves?</li>
  <li>How do we keep sight of the fact that each number in these datasets represents a human life?</li>
  <li>Projects like these draw a lot of traffic and praiseâ€”but are we staying focused on whatâ€™s most valuable to the public?</li>
  <li>And what did we learn (if anything!) that can contribute to other collaborative workflows?</li>
</ul>

<p>Our hope is to come out of this conversation with better ideas for tackling the technical and editorial logistics behind <em>very</em> open-ended data projects.</p>

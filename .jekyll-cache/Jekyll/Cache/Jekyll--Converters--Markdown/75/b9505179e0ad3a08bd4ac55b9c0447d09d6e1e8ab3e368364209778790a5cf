I"<p>Training on newsroom products is too often left until the last minute and conducted as a perfunctory exercise. Workshop participants at previous conferences report training themselves on tools and processes that are critical to their work. This makes our days more difficultâ€”and reinforces inequity and dominant hierarchies in the newsroom. Documentation is sometimes inaccessible or left to interns; already-marginalized folks get locked out of tech due to assumptions. Onboarding and professional development may be nonexistent, and teaching each other often seems beyond the scope of writing and editing duties.</p>

<p>This participatory train-the-trainers workshop will take you through a rubric of considerations to plan your own newsroom training on a new tool or product, while ensuring every staffer is fully included. Weâ€™ll collaboratively define and explore the problem space surrounding newsroom trainings. Then weâ€™ll co-teach with you, sharing established rubrics and strategies to jump-start training and documentation for any product. Whether youâ€™re a product stakeholder at a large organization or a staffer in a small newsroom, youâ€™ll leave this session with a set of tools and processes that have been shown to improve training outcomes and product adoption.</p>

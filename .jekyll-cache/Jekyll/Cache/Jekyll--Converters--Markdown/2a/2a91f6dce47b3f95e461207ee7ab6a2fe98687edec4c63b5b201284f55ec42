I"Ê<p>Climate change is one of the most wicked problems our communities faceâ€“and for too long weâ€™ve been throwing the standard journalism playbook at it: alarming headlines, beautiful data visualizations and expert sources, all crafted for mass consumption.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not working. When you write for everyone, the result is general climate emergency coverage that resonates with no one and fades from memory within hours of being published.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why in 2022, KPCC/LAist set out to redesign its coverage of the climate emergency through human-centered design research. We started with a few key questions: How do Southern Californians experience climate change, how can we lower barriers to understanding, and what type of information is most relevant and useful in their daily lives? We emerged from 20 interviews with a new set of guiding principles for the beat and four archetypes of climate change information seekers to serve: the stuck, the practically minded, the high information connectors, and the low information connectors.</p>

<p>In this session we will introduce you to our coverage principles and our four archetypes, and youâ€™ll hear from our climate emergency editor about how this research has influenced their view of the beat. Then weâ€™ll move into breakout groups; each group will be given a different archetype to design a prototype for. Weâ€™ll reconvene to share everyoneâ€™s ideas. (We were inspired by the SRCCON 2021 session led by Lindsay Abrams, where she did something similar.)</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll leave the session for a blueprint of how your own newsroom can tackle climate change and other wicked problems in a way that is relevant and reflective of your communityâ€™s experiences.</p>

I"I<p>Journalists report on conflict, but how do they deal with conflict in their own newsrooms and organizations? The question of engaging with conflict is more important than ever in lean organizations with diverse people performing so many different and cross-functional roles. Staying with and engaging in newsroom/organization conflict is not something that comes naturally to many journalists/tech people. Conflict can be perceived as disruptive and unprofessional. Many may avoid engaging in conflict because of a lack of skills, lack of perceived accountability, lack of time or fear of retaliation or a perception that engaging will not result in productive change. But in creative spaces, skillful conflict engagement from top down and bottom up can lead to better collaboration and better outcomes. This interactive session will provide participants with the opportunity to identify and analyze their conflict styles and then apply those concepts. A conflict engagement professional/professor and journalist/professor will lead the session and provide takeaways for your organization.</p>

I"~<p>Normally, SRCCON for some includes a visit to Target Field to watch MLB’s Minnesota Twins or a quick trip down the road to Midway Field to see their Triple-A affiliate, the St. Paul Saints. This year, while we’re not in Minneapolis, we can still virtually enjoy the sights and sounds of baseball (and each other’s company). We’ll take the first 30 minutes and talk about why the designated hitter rule shouldn’t exist in the National League (or not) and then tune in live to watch the New York Yankees host the Houston Astros in the Bronx. It’s a chance to take a breath, enjoy some of your favorite snacks, and relax.</p>

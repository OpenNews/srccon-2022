I"´<p>Letâ€™s see the cool projects you and your children have been working on at a casual show-and-tell â€” art projects and techniques, Legos, crafts, games, recipes, Pinewood Derby cars, etc. Or bring supplies and let us see your creative process in real-time. All grown-ups are welcome with or without a kid! Just please hold your profane embroidery and R-rated Lego builds for another time, and keep this session kid-appropriate.</p>

I"z<p>By paying everyday citizens to attend local government meetings and take notes that we then edit and make publicly available, Detroit Documenters provide a valuable service for our media partners and for Detroit residents. Before decisions become statutes or ordinances, they are ideas presented through memos and public comments, and discussed in public forums. Documenters who describe those discussions and decisions in their notes are inspired to become more civically active and to share what they learn with their family, friends and communities. By being present in these meetings and sharing the information with their networks, Documenters help shape the news and help keep public officials accountable to the public.</p>

<p>In this session, we’ll talk more about the Documenters program: how it started, how it’s going, and how we think it will grow. We’ll share tips that any newsroom can use to empower citizens by involving them in the news gathering and reporting process. Just knowing the public is paying attention can be enough to change the tone of a meeting from clandestine and exclusive to open and accessible.</p>

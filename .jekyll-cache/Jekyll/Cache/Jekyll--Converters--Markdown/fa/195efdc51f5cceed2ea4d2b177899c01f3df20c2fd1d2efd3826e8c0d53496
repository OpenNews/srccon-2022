I"=<p>Looking to get out of your head and into your body during SRCCON? Give Awakening Yoga a try. Awakening Yoga is a progressive yoga system rooted in Hatha Vinyasa with an emphasis on ritual &amp; self inquiry. Founded by Patrick Beach and Carling Harps, Awakening Yoga pays homage to the traditional nature of the yoga practice with a practical and functional approach to asana. This practice encourages personal exploration, potentiality, and freedom of movement from both the teacher and student.</p>

<p>The Set is a fixed sequence built on the Awakening Yoga Solar Vinyasa Practice. An organized and moving practice builds strength, coordination, and measured ability across a balanced array of postures. This class is designed to take the guesswork and decision fatigue out of your day, leaving you free to clear your mind, focus on your practice, and drop into the moment.</p>

<p>This 60-minute session will be suitable for practitioners of all levels â€” modifications will be offered along the way and props are always welcomed. Some experience with yoga is recommended.</p>

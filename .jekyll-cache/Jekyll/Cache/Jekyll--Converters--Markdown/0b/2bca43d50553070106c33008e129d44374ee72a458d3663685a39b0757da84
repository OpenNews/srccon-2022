I"‰<p>Most projects in journalism wonâ€™t run forever, but we often launch them without knowing when or how the end will come. In this session, weâ€™ll discuss practical approaches and considerations for sunsetting projects, such as trackers, tech products, long-running series and collaborations. Why are some endings satisfying and others disappointing, and what works well for preserving projects without creating ghosts of unfinished business? Drawing on lessons from other industries such as documentary filmmaking, education, sports and hospice care, weâ€™ll discuss what makes an ending a good one and how to manage less-than-ideal endings.</p>

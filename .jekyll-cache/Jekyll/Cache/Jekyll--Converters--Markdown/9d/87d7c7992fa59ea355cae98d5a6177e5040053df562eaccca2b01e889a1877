I"´<p>It can be hard to think about having a job thatâ€™s not in journalism. The idea of â€œleaving journalismâ€ can bring up a lot of feelings! Much of the camaraderie in the industry comes from all being in it together. So what does it mean to step away from that? Are you selling out? Can you come back? Will you even want to? What does it mean if you donâ€™t??</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked in journalism, in government agencies, and now in tech. I can share my own experience and how I felt through these transitions: excited, relieved, guilty, outraged, thrilled, uneasy, and more. But mostly this is space to think about your own future, outside the expectations of the journalism industry.</p>

I"¿<p>In the age of online communication, we have more information and stellar writing at our fingertips than ever before. And yet during the pandemic, people were taking horse medicine and refusing vaccines. The pandemic, the murder of George Floyd, and the increasing disasters related to wildfires, floods, and other weather all hit newsrooms at once. It was overwhelming. Letâ€™s take some time to process, and to talk to experts who have had different viewpoints on the media during these crises. In this discussion, weâ€™ll consider questions that include: How can we ensure that the painstaking work journalists put into informing people about the knowledge science offers reaches people in an age of rampant misinformation, disinformation, and polarization? Covering science brings up particular social cues around elitism, risk perception, how knowledge is formed, and which institutions are trustworthy in which situations. Weâ€™ll reflect on several major themes that have regularly come up in science coverage in recent years: the pandemic (vaccines, masks, school openings, testing, and lockdown); issues of inequality in science; and climate change.</p>

<p>Several scholars who study science misinformation will be available to help our group develop best practices for reporting on polarized (or potentially polarizing) science topics. Stephan Lewandowsky (University of Bristol), Jiyoung Lee (University of Alabama), Jaime Longoria (Disinfo Defense League, Media Democracy Fund), and Scott Knowles (COVIDCalls, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology) will summarize insights from their research and will field questions. The session will begin with 15 minutes of getting to know the panelists. Then weâ€™ll spend 15 minutes sharing with one another what experiences weâ€™ve had with these issues and questions. As these discussions progress, weâ€™ll develop a Google Doc with a set of take-home points and best practices for covering polarizing topics.</p>

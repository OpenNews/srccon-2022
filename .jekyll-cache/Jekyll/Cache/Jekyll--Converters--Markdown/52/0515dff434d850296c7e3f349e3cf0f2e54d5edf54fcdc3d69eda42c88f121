I"9<p>If newsrooms are truly working toward a more inclusive and fair workplace, then that must also apply to how job candidates are treated. Some things to consider: Do you pay candidates for the time they spend on hiring tests? Do you know what you’re testing for? Do you really need them to edit a 2,000-word story, write a cover letter that guesses at what you want to hear, or spend hours crafting a story that you get to publish for free?</p>

<p>Newsrooms have not traditionally considered the application process from the candidate’s point of view. Yet this is the person’s first interaction with your organization. If you say you’re a newsroom that values a person’s time, how do you show it in the application process? This session will offer some ideas that will hopefully jumpstart more from the room.</p>

I"<p>How might we change and improve the relationships between commissioning editors and freelance journalists who work in data, graphics, or news apps? The past couple years of the pandemic have changed the labor market for the foreseeable future. There’s a growing pool of data/graphics/dev journalists who quit their newsrooms and struck out on their own with the hopes of choosing the kind of work they wanted to do. At the same time, some editors are struggling to keep up with internal demand on their teams’ bandwidth and have some budget to hire contractors. We would love to know how to better connect these groups.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever done that kind of work as a freelancer/contractor, hired one, or are interested in doing either, then we want to hear from you. What works well? What could be improved? We’ll discuss these topics and create a guide that can be used by all parties. From recruiting candidates to finding opportunities to creating contracts and managing projects, let’s make this process better for everyone.</p>

I"2<p>We no longer consume news through a handful of TV channels and newspapersâ€”even the best journalism now moves through a media ecosystem full of cable commentary, social media, politically motivated actors, and motivated readers. And that makes it possible for our most well-meaning work, the accurate and illuminating coverage that people really need, to get remixed or misused in service of horrifying, harmful narratives.</p>

<p>So what should we do when readers draw selfish or wrong conclusions from our stories or data analysis? Like when researchers said that white Americans became less empathetic and less fearful of COVID-19 after reading about how COVID-19 disproportionately impacts poorer people and communities of color? Or when we cover the video of a viral crime and give people fodder to misinterpret it as a trend rather than an isolated incident?</p>

<p>The old tenets of journalism tell us we should just present the data and let people draw their own conclusions. But what responsibility do we have when some of those conclusions are terrible?</p>

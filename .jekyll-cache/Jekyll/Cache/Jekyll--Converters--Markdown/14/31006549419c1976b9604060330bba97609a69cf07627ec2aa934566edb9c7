I"¿<p>It hurts when people publicly criticize our work. You put time, energy, care into your journalism, and blunt complaints can feel callous. The voices we hear are often harsh, not constructive, and when they throw barbs at you or those close to you, it canâ€™t help but feel personal, too.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re not talking about accidents and errors hereâ€”we know how to respond to those with corrections. What we need to figure out is what to do with criticism that targets the assumptions we make as journalists, or attacks fundamental flaws in our practice. Sometimes our harshest critics are wrong, sure, but sometimes they see where weâ€™re missing perspectives, or failing them with reporting that doesnâ€™t push hard enough.</p>

<p>So how do we make sure we know the difference? Can we productively tell our critics when theyâ€™re wrong? More importantly, can we admit to ourselves when theyâ€™re right? How can we spot real opportunities to grow, to learn from the people engaging with our work, to reach into our communities and build trust? Letâ€™s talk about how to understand and address oppositional points of view in a pragmatic way, without compromising journalistic standards or personal beliefs.</p>

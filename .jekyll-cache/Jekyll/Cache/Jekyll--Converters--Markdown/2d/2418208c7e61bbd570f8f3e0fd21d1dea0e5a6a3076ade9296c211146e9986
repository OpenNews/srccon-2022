I"<p>To build the future of journalism, we need to look to the past. The conditions that drove historical struggles for an equitable media system closely resemble what’s happening today — including news coverage that further marginalizes BIPOC, poor, immigrant, and LGBTQ+ communities and media policies that enforce racial hierarchies and economic exploitation.</p>

<p>In this session, participants will explore the decades-long fight for media justice and learn how progress came when journalists, civil-rights campaigners and media activists joined together to take action. With this historical grounding, participants will analyze current conditions and discuss what collective power is needed to change the practices of journalism and the public policies that shape our media system.</p>

I"4<p>Stacey Peters is Chief Product Officer at VTDigger, where she oversees technology and product for Vermont’s largest newsroom. She was once a fast runner and now is a bit slower, but has many thoughts about using running to troubleshoot systems or coding issues as well as using running to take respite from those issues entirely. She’s currently getting ready to begin training in earnest for her third marathon, and looks forward to chatting with anyone who has discovered running for fun, for mental health, for fitness, or for none of those reasons.</p>

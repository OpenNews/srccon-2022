I"z<p>Have you ever stumbled upon a story about Y/N? Fallen down a rabbit hole of Archive of our Own, Wattpad, LiveJournal or Fanfiction.net, or wondered what people are talking about when they mention those sites? This session is for you — whether you’ve been a Gleek, a Directioner, an avid reader of My Hero Academia or Marvel fanfiction or have no idea what a headcanon is, let’s talk about it!</p>

<p>Fanfiction is exactly what it says: fans of a piece of media creating their own fictional stories — “headcanons” — within that world, whether it’s based in real life or fantasy. Both fanfiction and journalism exist on the same spectrum of objectivity, even if they’re on different ends: People make choices about what stories they’re telling, whose narratives they’re centering and what words they use to describe them. One of the ways journalism and fanfiction diverge that this session will cover: Fanfiction in itself is a sort of science fiction; we’re writing about an existence that is possible within the confines of an already existing world. By engaging with fanfiction and related communities, we have a chance to learn more about what it means to explore our identities, develop narratives which center the agency of marginalized communities and connect with folks from different backgrounds via common ground about a world that might be better than our own.</p>

I"f<p>People with ADHD tend to love fast-paced, exciting work where they get to work on new projects and learn different things every day. Journalism is perfect then, right? We also struggle with executive function, work-life balance, over-committing, perfectionism and meeting deadlines. (Oops. ðŸ™ƒ)</p>

<p>This session centers people with ADHD or who identify as neurodivergent (including but not limited to ADHD, sensory processing disorder, autism, synesthesia, learning disorders, high sensitivity) â€” including self-diagnosed! â€” and will serve as a place to share strategies for surviving as a journalist. We will share tips and tricks with each other, and focus on solutions. The facilitator will give an overview of how to request disability accommodations in the workplace per the Americans With Disabilities Act, and will share personal experiences with the process.</p>

<p>Those who do not identify as neurodivergent or as having ADHD are welcome to attend as listeners in order to learn how to best provide support â€” we politely ask that you do not share solutions or experiences if you choose to attend.</p>

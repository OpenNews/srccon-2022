I"Æ<p>Letâ€™s look at the role retirement plans play in personal finances and our fraught industry, from â€œitâ€™s all thatâ€™s availableâ€ to â€œadvanced Boglehead hackingâ€ (Iâ€™ll explain). I plan to share a diagram thatâ€™s been helpful for me in balancing life vs. savings vs. the future. I hope to have a collection of session attendees (like you!) where we collectively bring wisdom and insight about keeping retirement savings in perspective.</p>

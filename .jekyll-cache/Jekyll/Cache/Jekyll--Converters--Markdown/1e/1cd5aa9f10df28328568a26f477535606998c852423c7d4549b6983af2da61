I"ﬁ<p>Retention starts at the moment of hiring. Onboarding can make or break an experience, and sets the trajectory for the entire tenure of a job, especially in institutions built in a non-inclusive manner. We are going to engage onboarding as community building, examining what humans need from community, how to determine those needs in an inclusive and empowering manner and how onboarding can set the stage for fulfilling them. From basic logistics of ‚Äúwhere do I live?‚Äù to unpacking communication norms and other community needs. At the end of the session our goal is to have a living worksheet/checklist that anyone can use to harness onboarding as community building and a framework for making workplaces more inclusive.</p>

    <p>Craig Newmark Philanthropies was created by craigslist founder Craig Newmark to support and connect people and drive broad civic engagement. It works to advance people and grassroots organizations that are getting stuff done in areas that include trustworthy journalism & the information ecosystem, voter protection, gender diversity in technology, and veterans & military families.

    <p>The Truth is Essential and weâ€™re excited to be able to support the community of people who seek it at SRCCON. The New York Times is a continually evolving team of journalists, coders, designers, product managers (and people who don't fit into any of those categories) all contributing to the 160+ year history of the Grey Lady.</p>

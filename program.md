# Our Program

The following sessions have been confirmed so far for {{ page.event_name }}. Thank you to everyone who submitted proposals! We still have a handful of sessions left to finalize, and descriptions here will evolve in the weeks leading up to {{ page.event_name }}.

We'll publish the complete schedule in early June.

## Talks

We'll have three talks on our program this year—one each day, also available to watch in advance. Talks at SRCCON help create a foundation we can build on during conversations throughout the week.

_More details about each talk coming soon!_

## Sessions 

Thank you to the [community panel](#community-review) that helped us during our review process! Our conference schedule this year will include the sessions below.

## Community reviewers

We'd also like to thank the folks who helped us select this amazing slate of sessions! Each year's program review includes a panel of community members with a range of experiences and perspectives to make sure SRCCON has sessions that respond to your needs.

Thank you, community reviewers!

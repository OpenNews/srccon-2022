# Call for participation

We can't wait to hear how you'd like to participate at {{ page.event_name }}! If you want to attend, facilitate a session, or [take part in some other way](/attendees), this one form is where to let us know. The deadline to propose a session or apply for a stipend is April 25, and we'll keep this form open for attendees as long as space remains available.

After we review your form, we will let you know whether you are invited to attend or facilitate. If so, we will send a link so you can purchase a ticket to {{ page.event_name }}, with <a href="/attendees/#tickets">prices starting at $125 plus fees</a>.

Our [session proposal guide](/sessions/proposal-guide/) answers a lot of questions about bringing your ideas to the {{ page.event_name }} program. Please feel free to reach out to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) with any questions. If you're all set, the participation form is below!

### After you submit your form entry

Thanks for your interest in SRCCON! If you applied to attend or proposed an idea for the program, we'll get in touch by May 4! Similarly, if you asked about stipends or let us know about some other way you'd like to participate at SRCCON 2022, we'll follow up with you on those things by May 4 as well.

Do you have a colleague who you'd like to see join us June 22-24? Please ask them to apply! Personal recommendations are the best way to bring more people into this community, and your help reaching beyond our own networks is a key part of making sure SRCCON events are inclusive and representative.

If you have any additional session proposals, or any questions, send them our way here: [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org). Thank you!
